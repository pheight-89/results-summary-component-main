## Overview

Another challenge from Frontend Mentor that enabled me to utilize media queries for mobile responsiveness.

## My process

I utilized the mobile first design approach. I then estimated the elements positions and layout as best as I could.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use grid and flexbox to create the layout. I found that grid is extremely intuitive. I also learned some media queries with this project.

### Continued development

I want to continue developing grid layouts and eventually add some javascript to my projects.

### Useful resources

(https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with understanding how to use CSS Flex Properties.
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - Kevin Powell's video on CSS Grid is an invaluable resource. Made learning grid intiutive.
